                <p>
                    This website has the idea of creating a blog with articles about:
                    <em>bio food, exercises, health and skin care.</em>
                    The idea is simple.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The home page has a navigation menu that includes all the categories discribed above.
                    It includes a database that has the catogory( specifically all the menus above), the title, the descrpition, the author and the date.

            <div class="blog_description_parts">

                <img src="img/BlogWebsite2.jpg" class="myImg" />

                <p>
                    The Home menu includes a <em> slideshow </em>, made with <em> JavaScript</em> that change every 3 seconds.
                    It takes from the databese the last 3 articles ordered by date, using <em>PHP and MySQL </em>and shows in
                    the page on photo of the article,the title and a short description.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Home menu, also takes all the last articles by the database ordered by date, using <em>PHP and MySQL</em>,
                    and shows them in page including a photo, the title, a short description and the author and the date.

                <p>
                    Every other category has the same idea as home. The technics used are the same.
                    The only differnce in the code is that it select the articles of the
                    specific category. This is also made with <em>PHP and MySql Select </em>function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The user can click in the photo or in the title of every article and this is <em>conected with PHP with the specific article clicked.</em>
                    This opens a page of every article that has the title the descripton, 2 photos.
                    <br />
